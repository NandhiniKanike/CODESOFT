üìö **Overview
**
CODESOFT is a collection of machine learning projects implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. Each project demonstrates practical applications of machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems.

üß† Projects Included
**1.** Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Objective:** Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

**Key Techniques:** Data preprocessing, normalization, handling class imbalance, model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), and performance evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

**2.** Movie Recommendation System

**Objective:** Develop a recommendation system to suggest movies based on user preferences.

**Key Techniques:** Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendation methods.

**3.** Titanic Survival Prediction

**Objective:** Predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic.

**Key Techniques:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees), and evaluation.
